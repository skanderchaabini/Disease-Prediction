# Disease-Prediction
An academic project for Machine Learning course

## General Context
A new disease has recently been discovered by Dr. Smith, in England. The disease has already affected more than 5000 people, with no apparent connection between them.  

The conditions of the transmission of the disease are still unknown and there are no certainties of what leads a patient to suffer or not from it. Nonetheless, some groups of people seem more prone to be infected by the parasite than others.  

In this challenge, the goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question, “Who are the people more likely to suffer from the Smith Parasite?”. With that goal, we have limited access to sociodemographic, health, and behavioral information obtained from the patients.
